What is count100?

Count100 is a csv of selected unigrams counts from the title and text fields of the McIntire fake news dataset.
It also has entries for the length of the title and text.


How were unigrams selected?

In order to be present in the feature vector, each unigram must appear more than 100 times in the
6314 entry dataset.


How many entries?

There are 6314 entries in this dataset - this is less than the original dataset,
since I have removed corrupted entries from the csv file. 


How many fake and real entries?

There are 3153 fake news articles and 3161 real news articles in the dataset, as judged by the creators.
